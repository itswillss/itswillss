## Brief Introduction

I am a third-year B.S. in Cybersecurity student dedicated to the engineering side of security. My focus is on building and maintaining resilient systems that are secure by design. I am passionate about moving beyond simple analysis to actively engineering solutions that automate defense and harden infrastructure.

## Objective

Currently pursuing my B.S. in Cybersecurity, I am eager to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice. My objective is to secure a Junior Cybersecurity Engineering role or internship where I can apply my foundation in network security and system hardening to help build and maintain secure enterprise infrastructures.
